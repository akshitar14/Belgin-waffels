procedure:
     *Heat water to 110Â°F and pour into mixing bowl. Add the sugar and yeast to the warmed water, stir and allow to stand for 5 minutes.

     *After the yeast mixture has stood for 5 minutes, add the flour and sugar. Warm the milk to lukewarm.

     *Add the melted butter, vanilla, cinnamon, salt and egg yolks.

     *Mix ingredients until batter is smooth.

     *When finished mixing, cover the bowl and allow the batter to rest for approximately half an hour. The batter will rise during this time.

     * While the batter is resting, beat the egg whites until they become fomy.

     *Add the beaten egg whites to the risen batter.

     *Mix this beaten egg and the batter thoroughly.

     *Heat the waffle maker to a medium heat. After the surface is properly heated, pour the batter into the maker.

     *Pour until the batter just about reaches the edge. Stop pouring and close the lid of the waffle maker carefully so that the batter doesn't overflow.

     *Bake the waffle until golden brown, approximately 4 to 5 minutes.

     *Your belgein waffles are ready.
